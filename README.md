# Tabletop Scores
This is a web application built for board gamers to track scores against their friends. After logging in with a Google account, a user can add game sessions which will track which game, which users, and their scores for a particular gaming session. Games can be added to the database and updated by users of the application. This project was created as the back-end project for DigitalCrafts, a four month immersive coding school.
